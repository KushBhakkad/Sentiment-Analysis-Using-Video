# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Video

This project demonstrates real-time sentiment analysis using video input from a webcam. By analyzing facial expressions, the model predicts emotions such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. It leverages OpenCV for face detection and a pre-trained deep learning model for emotion classification.

**Features**

-Real-time emotion detection using webcam input.
-Accurate face detection with Haar cascades.
-Emotion classification using a pre-trained Keras model.

**Requirements**
-Python 3.7 or later
-Webcam for capturing video input

**Emotion Labels**

The model predicts the following emotions:
-Angry
-Disgust
-Fear
-Happy
-Neutral
-Sad
-Surprise
